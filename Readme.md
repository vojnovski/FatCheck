FatCheck
--------

An iOS8+/HealthKit app for quick entry of weight into HealthKit, as well as a
learning iOS development project.

The app retrieves your last recorded weight from the HealthKit store, and
allows you to make a quick entry of a new weight with a slider, rather than
inputting it through the Apple Health app.

It will not allow you to enter a new weight more than once every 10 minutes,
and it needs that at least one data point is already present in HealthKit.
